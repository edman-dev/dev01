# Product Requirements Document: Post-Event Feedback System

## Introduction/Overview

The Post-Event Feedback System automatically collects insights and evaluations after worship services to drive continuous improvement. This module triggers surveys to team members and key stakeholders once events conclude, gathering feedback on technical execution, spiritual impact, and suggestions for enhancement. The system provides analytics and reporting to help worship leaders identify trends and make data-driven decisions for future services.

## Goals

1. **Drive Continuous Improvement:** Systematically collect feedback to enhance worship service quality over time.

2. **Capture Multiple Perspectives:** Gather insights from various team members to get comprehensive service evaluation.

3. **Identify Patterns:** Track feedback trends to recognize recurring issues or successful practices.

4. **Measure Spiritual Impact:** Understand how services affect participants spiritually, not just technically.

5. **Close Feedback Loop:** Ensure feedback leads to actionable improvements in future services.
