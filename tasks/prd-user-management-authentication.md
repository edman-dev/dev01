# Product Requirements Document: User Management & Authentication

## Introduction/Overview

The User Management & Authentication module provides the foundation for securing the Worship Team Planning Service and managing user access. This system integrates with Clerk for authentication while implementing custom role-based access control (RBAC) to support four distinct user types: Admin, Worship Leader, Pastor, and Collaborator. The module ensures secure multi-tenant data isolation and provides a seamless authentication experience.

## Goals

1. **Secure Authentication:** Provide enterprise-grade authentication with support for social logins, MFA, and passkeys through Clerk integration.

2. **Role-Based Access Control:** Implement granular permissions for four distinct user roles to ensure users only access features appropriate to their responsibilities.

3. **Multi-Tenancy Support:** Ensure complete data isolation between organizations while allowing users to belong to multiple organizations.

4. **Seamless User Experience:** Create an intuitive authentication flow that minimizes friction while maintaining security.

5. **Scalable User Management:** Support growth from small churches to large multi-campus operations with thousands of users.

## User Stories

**As a new user:**
- I want to sign up using my email or social login so that I can quickly start using the platform.
- I want to receive a welcome email with instructions so that I know how to get started.
- I want to join an existing organization using an invitation link so that I can collaborate with my team.

**As an existing user:**
- I want to sign in securely using my preferred method so that I can access my account.
- I want to enable MFA or passkeys so that my account is more secure.
- I want to switch between multiple organizations I belong to so that I can manage different churches.

**As an Admin:**
- I want to invite new users to my organization so that they can join our worship planning team.
- I want to assign roles to users so that they have appropriate permissions.
- I want to remove users from my organization so that former team members no longer have access.
- I want to view user activity logs so that I can monitor system usage.

**As any authenticated user:**
- I want to update my profile information so that my team knows who I am.
- I want to manage my notification preferences so that I receive relevant updates.
- I want to reset my password securely so that I can regain access if needed.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Authentication System

1.1. The system must integrate with Clerk for all authentication operations.

1.2. The system must support the following authentication methods:
   - Email/password
   - Google OAuth
   - Microsoft OAuth
   - Apple Sign In
   - Magic link authentication

1.3. The system must support multi-factor authentication (MFA) options:
   - SMS-based OTP
   - Authenticator app (TOTP)
   - Passkeys (WebAuthn)

1.4. The system must handle authentication errors gracefully with clear user messaging.

1.5. The system must maintain session security with automatic timeout after inactivity.

### 2. User Roles & Permissions

2.1. The system must support four distinct user roles:
   - **Admin**: Full system access, user management, billing management
   - **Worship Leader**: Create/edit hymns and programs, manage team assignments
   - **Pastor**: Oversee all worship activities, approve programs, provide feedback
   - **Collaborator**: View assigned programs, provide feedback, view schedules

2.2. The system must enforce role-based permissions at both UI and API levels.

2.3. The system must allow users to have different roles in different organizations.

2.4. The system must provide a permission matrix that clearly defines what each role can do.

### 3. User Profile Management

3.1. The system must maintain user profiles with the following information:
   - Full name
   - Email address
   - Profile photo
   - Preferred language
   - Time zone
   - Phone number (optional)
   - Bio/description (optional)

3.2. The system must allow users to update their own profile information.

3.3. The system must validate profile data (email format, phone number format).

3.4. The system must support profile photo upload with appropriate size limits.

### 4. Organization Membership

4.1. The system must allow users to belong to multiple organizations.

4.2. The system must provide organization switching functionality in the UI.

4.3. The system must maintain separate roles for users in each organization.

4.4. The system must track the user's current active organization in their session.

### 5. User Invitation System

5.1. The system must allow Admins to invite new users via email.

5.2. The system must generate secure, time-limited invitation links.

5.3. The system must allow role assignment during the invitation process.

5.4. The system must send customized invitation emails with organization branding.

5.5. The system must handle invitation acceptance and automatic organization joining.

### 6. Security & Compliance

6.1. The system must enforce strong password requirements (min 8 characters, complexity rules).

6.2. The system must implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints.

6.3. The system must log all authentication events for security auditing.

6.4. The system must support account lockout after failed login attempts.

6.5. The system must provide secure password reset functionality.

6.6. The system must ensure GDPR compliance for user data handling.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Custom Authentication Provider:** The system will not implement its own authentication backend, relying entirely on Clerk.

2. **Single Sign-On (SSO) for Enterprise:** SAML or custom SSO integrations are not included in this phase.

3. **User Directory Sync:** Integration with LDAP/Active Directory is not included.

4. **Advanced Analytics:** Detailed user behavior analytics beyond basic activity logs.

5. **Custom Role Creation:** The four predefined roles are fixed; custom roles cannot be created.

## Design Considerations

1. **Authentication UI:** Leverage Clerk's pre-built components for consistency and security.

2. **Role Indicators:** Clear visual indicators in the UI showing user's current role and permissions.

3. **Organization Switcher:** Prominent UI element for switching between organizations.

4. **Profile Management:** Dedicated settings page for user profile management.

5. **Security Badges:** Visual indicators for MFA-enabled accounts and verification status.

## Technical Considerations

1. **Clerk Integration:** Utilize Clerk's SDK for all authentication operations and webhook events.

2. **Database Schema:** Extend user table to include role assignments and organization memberships.

3. **Middleware Implementation:** Create Next.js middleware for route protection and role verification.

4. **Session Management:** Implement proper session handling with Clerk's session tokens.

5. **API Security:** Ensure all API endpoints validate user permissions before processing requests.

6. **Caching Strategy:** Cache user permissions to reduce database queries on each request.

## Success Metrics

1. **Authentication Success Rate:** 95%+ successful login attempts (excluding invalid credentials).

2. **Time to First Login:** Average user completes signup and first login within 2 minutes.

3. **MFA Adoption:** 30% of users enable MFA within first month.

4. **Password Reset Rate:** Less than 5% of users need password reset per month.

5. **Invitation Acceptance:** 80%+ of invited users accept and join organizations.

6. **Session Security:** Zero unauthorized access incidents due to session vulnerabilities.

## Open Questions

1. **Role Flexibility:** Should we allow organizations to customize permissions within predefined roles?

2. **Guest Access:** Should we support limited guest access for viewing public worship programs?

3. **Account Merging:** How do we handle users who sign up with different methods but same email?

4. **Inactive Users:** Should we implement automatic account deactivation after extended inactivity?

5. **Compliance Requirements:** Are there specific compliance requirements for churches in different regions?

6. **Bulk Operations:** Should admins be able to bulk invite or bulk update user roles?
