# Product Requirements Document: Hymn Management System

## Introduction/Overview

The Hymn Management System is a comprehensive digital library that enables churches to create, organize, and share worship music resources. This module addresses the need for a centralized repository of hymns with rich metadata, multi-language support, and innovative audio-lyric synchronization capabilities. The system supports three types of hymns (official, user-created, and public) while maintaining appropriate copyright and sharing controls.

## Goals

1. **Build Comprehensive Hymn Library:** Create a searchable, well-organized repository of worship music with rich metadata and multimedia support.

2. **Enable Audio-Lyric Synchronization:** Provide karaoke-style playback that synchronizes lyrics with audio for enhanced worship preparation and presentation.

3. **Support Multi-Language Worship:** Enable churches to maintain hymns in multiple languages to serve diverse congregations.

4. **Foster Community Sharing:** Allow churches to share their original hymns with the broader community while respecting copyright.

5. **Simplify Hymn Discovery:** Provide powerful search and filtering capabilities to help worship leaders find appropriate hymns quickly.

## Open Questions

3. **Sync Sharing:** Should sync timing be shareable separately from hymns?

4. **Version Control:** How many versions of lyrics should we maintain?

5. **Offline Support:** Should hymns be downloadable for offline access?

6. **AI Integration:** Should we add AI-powered features like automated sync or hymn suggestions?

7. **Community Features:** Should we add ratings, reviews, or comments for public hymns?
