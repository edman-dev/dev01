# Product Requirements Document: Calendar & Event Management

## Introduction/Overview

The Calendar & Event Management module provides a visual interface for scheduling and managing worship services across the entire organization. This system handles complex recurring patterns, displays events with ministry-specific visual identifiers, and ensures proper filtering based on user permissions. The calendar serves as the central hub for understanding when worship services occur and helps teams coordinate their planning efforts.

## Goals

1. **Centralize Event Scheduling:** Provide a single calendar view showing all worship events across churches and ministries.

2. **Support Complex Patterns:** Handle various recurring event patterns that match real-world worship schedules.

3. **Enable Visual Organization:** Use colors and icons to make events instantly recognizable by ministry.

4. **Streamline Planning:** Help worship leaders see upcoming events that need programs and preparation.

5. **Facilitate Coordination:** Prevent scheduling conflicts and enable better resource allocation.
